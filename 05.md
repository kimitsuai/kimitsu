## Chapter 5: A Sniper’s Calling

The dim glow of a single lamp barely illuminated the room, casting long shadows over the sparse furnishings. Aiko sat on the edge of her bed, the file in her lap still unopened. She exhaled slowly, her fingers tracing the smooth surface of the manila folder. She knew what was inside, what the next mission would entail. Kimitsu’s reach was vast, and her job was to make sure that their opposition was silenced—efficiently, quietly. Yet, lately, the weight of her assignments had begun to press down on her more than ever before.

She finally opened the file, flipping through the pages methodically. The target was a politician, a man named Yamaguchi Hiroshi. He had made waves recently, publicly denouncing Kimitsu and calling for a full investigation into the company’s shadowy dealings. Aiko scanned his photo—an older man, silver hair, and a stoic face. He looked like the kind of man who wouldn’t go down easily, the kind who would fight until his last breath. Her stomach tightened, an unfamiliar sensation creeping in. She had killed men like him before—idealists, fighters, people who believed in something bigger than themselves.

Her gaze drifted to the disassembled sniper rifle on the table beside her. The rifle had been her companion for years, as much a part of her as the missions she accepted. She could assemble it blindfolded, her hands moving with precision, muscle memory guiding her through each meticulous step. But tonight, she hesitated.

Next to the rifle lay a small photo. She picked it up gingerly, her thumb brushing over the image. It was from a previous mission—a successful one. The face of the man in the photo was blurred now, but she remembered him. She remembered how easily his life had slipped away under the weight of a bullet she had fired. For the first time, the realization settled deep within her: they were more than just targets. They were people. And Kimitsu was playing a dangerous game, one that manipulated not only its enemies but also those who served its interests.

Aiko closed the file with a sharp snap, her jaw clenched. She wasn’t losing her edge, she told herself. This was just another job, like all the others. But her fingers hovered over her weapon, lingering as if betraying her uncertainty. Could she really continue doing this? Could she keep being a cog in Kimitsu’s monstrous machine?

The air in the room felt heavier now, thick with tension and doubt. The silence was deafening, but she had made her decision. She would see this mission through. After all, she had no choice. Not yet.

The quiet hum of computers filled the police precinct as Sakura Watanabe typed away, her eyes glued to the multiple screens in front of her. The footage from the crime scene played over and over, the same frames on a loop as she scrutinized every pixel. Haruto Nakamura, standing behind her, was less patient. His fingers drummed a relentless rhythm on the edge of her desk.

"Anything yet?" he muttered, his voice edged with frustration.

"Give me a second," Sakura replied, her tone even, calm, despite the growing tension. She had long grown accustomed to Haruto’s impatience, but she wouldn’t let it affect her focus.

The footage had seemed normal at first—a politician’s rally, crowds milling about, nothing out of the ordinary. But Sakura had learned long ago that appearances could be deceiving. There was something off, something she couldn’t quite put her finger on.

"Wait," she said, her fingers pausing on the keyboard. "There."

Haruto leaned in, squinting at the screen. "What?"

Sakura rewound the footage, slowing it down frame by frame. In the corner of the screen, barely noticeable, was a glitch. The video seemed to stutter, just for a split second, before continuing as if nothing had happened. But that tiny glitch told Sakura everything she needed to know.

"Someone tampered with this footage," she said, her voice tinged with excitement. "Look, right there. It’s subtle, but the AI system was used to cover up something—or someone."

Haruto’s brows furrowed. "You’re telling me the AI was used to erase the sniper? To hide them from the footage?"

Sakura nodded. "Exactly. This isn’t just a simple murder anymore, Haruto. Kimitsu’s involvement goes deeper than we thought. They’re not just orchestrating hits—they’re covering their tracks using advanced AI. It’s all a part of the same puzzle."

Haruto cursed under his breath, the complexity of the case weighing heavier with each new revelation. "This just keeps getting worse. If Kimitsu’s controlling the narrative, we’re dealing with more than just a crime syndicate. They’re controlling the entire story."

Sakura tapped a few keys, enhancing the image as much as she could. "We need to track down whoever did this. The sniper, the AI programmer—there’s a trail, even if they’ve done their best to hide it."

But before they could dig further, Haruto’s phone buzzed loudly on the desk. He picked it up, his expression darkening as he read the message.

"I’ve got to go," he said abruptly, already grabbing his coat. "Informant’s waiting for me."

"Be careful," Sakura called after him, but he was already out the door.

The underground bar was bathed in a sickly neon glow, its patrons huddled in corners nursing drinks as if they could escape the tension that clung to the air. Haruto pushed through the heavy door, his trench coat billowing around him. He scanned the room quickly, spotting his informant at a corner booth, his face hidden beneath a baseball cap.

Takeshi looked jumpy, his eyes darting around the room as if expecting someone to grab him at any moment. Haruto slid into the booth across from him, his gaze steely.

"Talk," Haruto said, wasting no time. "What do you have for me?"

Takeshi shifted nervously, wiping sweat from his brow. "You don’t know how dangerous this is, man. Kimitsu’s not just pulling strings from the shadows. They’ve got their hands in everything—politics, media, law enforcement. They’re untouchable."

Haruto’s jaw clenched. "I don’t care how big they are. I need names. Who’s behind Mori’s assassination?"

Takeshi hesitated, his hands trembling. "There’s a council. A group of elites working for Kimitsu. They decide who lives, who dies, and who stays in power. Mori was just the beginning. Anyone who stands up to them is marked."

Just as Takeshi began to speak again, the door to the bar swung open, and Haruto’s instincts flared. Three men entered, their eyes locking onto him immediately. Thugs. Kimitsu’s muscle. They weren’t here for drinks.

"Get down!" Haruto hissed, flipping the table on its side just as the first bullet whizzed past his head.

The bar erupted into chaos. Patrons screamed and scrambled for cover as gunfire shattered bottles and glass. Haruto ducked low, grabbing Takeshi by the collar and dragging him toward the back exit.

"Move!" Haruto shouted, his voice barely audible over the cacophony.

The thugs advanced, their shots wild and uncoordinated, but Haruto’s path was clear. He knocked over chairs, kicking open the back door as they burst into the alley behind the bar. The rain had started, the cold drops hitting his face as they ran, their footsteps echoing off the wet pavement.

"Keep running!" Haruto ordered, but Takeshi stumbled, clutching his side.

Haruto cursed, half-carrying the man as they weaved through the dark alleyways. The thugs were close, too close. But then, out of nowhere, Takeshi shoved a small phone into Haruto’s hand, his breath ragged.

"It’s all here," Takeshi gasped. "The names, the accounts. Everything you need."

Before Haruto could respond, a shot rang out, and Takeshi crumpled to the ground, his body lifeless. Haruto froze for a split second, his mind reeling, but there was no time to grieve. The thugs were closing in.

He pocketed the phone, ducking into a side street just as the sound of sirens filled the night air. Haruto knew that Takeshi had just handed him the key to bringing down Kimitsu—but at what cost?

As he disappeared into the maze of alleyways, Haruto couldn’t shake the feeling that the walls were closing in. Kimitsu was everywhere, and they wouldn’t stop until they silenced every last person who dared to oppose them.

And in the distance, high above the city, Aiko stood on a rooftop, her sniper rifle assembled and ready. But this time, as she looked through the scope at her next target, her finger hesitated on the trigger.
