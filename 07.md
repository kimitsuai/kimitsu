## Chapter 7: Death in the Shadows

The grand ballroom was bathed in golden light, crystal chandeliers hanging from the vaulted ceiling, their brilliance casting long, shimmering reflections on the polished marble floor. Politicians, dignitaries, and their entourages moved through the room like pieces on a chessboard, their hushed conversations blending into a soft, indistinct hum. The weight of recent assassinations loomed over the event, unspoken yet palpable. Security was tight, with bodyguards lining the walls, their eyes scanning the crowd for any hint of danger.

Haruto Nakamura felt like a wolf in a lion’s den. His dark, rumpled suit clung awkwardly to his broad shoulders, and his usual scowl deepened as he moved through the throngs of Tokyo’s elite. He hated these kinds of events—the pretense, the politics. But tonight, he had no choice. Somewhere in this room, another death was being planned.

"You look like you're about to chew someone’s head off," Sakura Watanabe whispered as she glided past him, her own attire blending effortlessly with the high-society crowd. Her gown sparkled under the ballroom lights, yet her eyes were sharp, calculating, scanning each face with precision.

"Out of my element," Haruto grunted, tugging at the collar of his shirt. He felt stifled, like a caged animal, surrounded by these polished, smug politicians who pretended to have control over the chaos outside the walls of their lavish world.

"Relax," Sakura murmured, never breaking her stride. "We’re here to observe. Blend in. I’ll do the digging; you just don’t make a scene."

Haruto glared at her, but said nothing. He trusted Sakura—her calm, methodical approach was what kept him grounded, especially when his own instincts threatened to push him over the edge. Still, he hated feeling useless, and tonight, every second they spent in this room felt like another step closer to disaster.

As they moved deeper into the crowd, Haruto's eyes flicked over the various politicians, their conversations punctuated by cautious glances and hushed tones. Every face in the room could be a target. Or worse—a collaborator.

Sakura, ever observant, noticed subtle exchanges between a few key players—a brief meeting of eyes, a hand gesture too quick for most to catch. She sidled up to Haruto, her voice low. "Something’s off. Certain people are communicating without saying a word. We’re not just dealing with an assassin, Haruto. This is bigger."

Before he could respond, a tall figure bumped into Haruto’s shoulder. The man, a high-ranking official, barely spared him a glance as he continued toward a small group of suited men in the corner of the room. Haruto's fists clenched, but he forced himself to stay calm. Any wrong move here could alert their enemies. They had to play it smart.

Above them, on a darkened rooftop across the street, Aiko knelt in silence, her sniper rifle laid out before her. The cool night air nipped at her exposed skin, but she barely felt it. Her focus was absolute.

Through the high-powered scope, she could see everything—the grand ballroom, the glittering chandeliers, the politicians mingling below. Her target was among them. Kimitsu had been explicit in their orders: eliminate the threat tonight.

But as Aiko adjusted her position, her hands steady on the cold metal of the rifle, doubt crept in again. The same doubt that had plagued her since the last mission. She had been an assassin for years, carrying out orders without question, a tool in Kimitsu's grand scheme. But now... she wasn’t so sure. The faces of her previous targets flashed in her mind, and the weight of her actions began to settle heavily on her shoulders.

Aiko steadied her breathing, trying to shake the uncertainty. It wasn’t her job to ask questions. It was her job to follow orders. But as she peered through the scope, focusing on the figures moving beneath the ballroom’s gilded ceiling, she felt the tug of something she hadn’t allowed herself to feel in years: guilt.

She locked onto her target—an older man in a sleek, tailored suit, his back turned toward her as he spoke with another politician. One shot, that’s all it would take. One pull of the trigger, and it would be over.

But her finger hesitated. Her mind raced. Was this really for the greater good? Was Kimitsu’s vision truly the right one, or had she been nothing more than a pawn all along?

A soft breeze whispered across the rooftop, and Aiko made her decision. If Haruto and Sakura were as good as she suspected, they would be able to find her. She would leave them a trail. Just enough to let them know where she was. It was a risk, one that might cost her her life, but she couldn’t pull the trigger. Not this time.

Aiko shifted slightly, angling the rifle so that the scope’s reflection caught the light from the ballroom. A flicker, a flash—just enough for someone alert to notice. Her heart raced as she lowered the rifle again, waiting. Her mind wandered far away.

Inside the ballroom, Sakura’s eyes narrowed as she watched the flicker of light from a distant rooftop. It was faint, almost imperceptible, but it was enough to send a shiver of realization down her spine. She grabbed Haruto’s arm.

"Sniper," she whispered urgently, her voice barely audible over the din of the party.

Haruto followed her gaze, his jaw tightening. "Where?"

"Rooftop, across the street. I’m sure of it," she said, already pulling out her phone to access the building’s security feed. "I need to get a closer look."

Haruto didn’t need to be told twice. Without another word, he turned and began weaving his way through the crowd, heading for the nearest exit. His pulse quickened. If they didn’t act fast, another high-profile politician would die tonight—and this time, it would be on his watch.

Sakura stayed behind, her fingers flying across her phone as she hacked into the hotel’s security system. She had to confirm her suspicions before they moved. If Aiko was up there, it meant the game was more complicated than they thought.

As the security cameras loaded, Sakura's face paled. The rooftop was clear, save for a lone figure crouched near the edge, rifle in hand. It was Aiko, just as they had feared.

"S***," she muttered under her breath. "Haruto, it’s her."

Haruto’s voice crackled through the earpiece. "I’m already on my way up."

Sakura felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead. "Be careful. She’s not just any sniper. If she wants you dead, you’ll never see it coming."

Haruto barreled through the stairwell, his footsteps echoing off the concrete walls as he climbed toward the rooftop. His mind raced, piecing together the fragments of the puzzle. Aiko had been involved in every one of Kimitsu’s hits so far, but why was she hesitating now? Why leave clues for them?

The door to the rooftop loomed ahead, and Haruto paused, his hand hovering over the handle. He took a deep breath, steadying himself before pushing it open.

The rooftop was cold, wind cutting through the air as Haruto stepped out, his eyes scanning the darkness. There, near the edge, was Aiko. She hadn’t moved, her rifle still trained on the ballroom below. But she wasn’t taking the shot.

"Aiko!" Haruto’s voice cut through the night, sharp and commanding. She didn’t turn, didn’t react, but he could see her shoulders tense. She had heard him.

"You don’t have to do this," he said, taking a cautious step forward. His hand hovered near his holster, ready for anything. "You can walk away."

Aiko’s voice, when it came, was quiet, almost resigned. "It’s not that simple."

Haruto took another step. "It never is. But you don’t have to pull that trigger. You’ve already left us a way to find you. Why?"

A long silence stretched between them, the tension thick in the air. Finally, Aiko lowered the rifle, her grip loosening as it rested against her lap. She turned to face Haruto, her eyes shadowed with exhaustion and doubt.

"I don’t know anymore," she whispered. "I don’t know what’s right or wrong. I just know I can’t keep doing this."

Before Haruto could respond, a deafening crack split the night. A gunshot.

Aiko stumbled backward, her eyes wide with shock as blood bloomed across her chest. Haruto rushed forward, catching her as she collapsed into his arms, her breath shallow and ragged.

From a nearby rooftop, the figure of another sniper melted into the shadows, their job complete.

Sakura’s voice screamed through Haruto’s earpiece. "Haruto! What happened?!"

He looked down at Aiko, her life slipping away with every passing second. "It’s too late," he said, his voice hoarse. "There’s another one. She wasn’t the only one."

Aiko’s hand grasped his sleeve, her voice barely a whisper. "I’m... sorry."

And then, she was gone.
