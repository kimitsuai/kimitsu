Chapter 14: The AI Engineer

The apartment was a forgotten relic, tucked away in one of Tokyo’s crumbling outer districts. Haruto Nakamura and Sakura Watanabe approached it with a heightened sense of caution. The building itself seemed abandoned, the kind of place where whispers of secrets clung to the walls and every creak could mean danger. The street was quiet, unnaturally so, and the dim glow of a single streetlight barely cut through the suffocating darkness. Haruto’s instincts were on high alert.

“This is the place?” Haruto asked in a gruff whisper, his hand resting on his holster. His eyes scanned the surrounding alleyways, searching for anything out of place.

Sakura, who had spent hours tracking down the AI engineer, nodded, her expression tense. “Yes. He’s inside. But he’s been hiding for months. We need to be careful—he’s terrified of Kimitsu.”

The door to the building was half off its hinges, creaking as Haruto pushed it open. The stairwell was damp and smelled of mildew, the air thick with decay. They ascended slowly, their footsteps echoing against the concrete walls. Each floor felt like a different layer of forgotten history, abandoned rooms with shattered windows and broken furniture strewn about.

When they reached the door to the apartment, Sakura hesitated, glancing at Haruto. “Let me do the talking. We need him to trust us.”

Haruto grunted in response, his impatience barely masked. His approach to these situations was always direct, but he knew that in this case, Sakura’s expertise was needed. She had the finesse that he lacked when it came to dealing with delicate situations, especially involving someone as critical as this engineer.

Sakura knocked softly, three times. The silence stretched for a moment, and then the sound of metal sliding against metal indicated the door was being unlocked. The door cracked open, and a single eye peeked out through the gap.

“You’re the one who’s been messaging me?” came a voice from behind the door—jittery, on edge.

“Yes. We’re here to help,” Sakura replied gently, stepping forward. “We need to talk about Kimitsu.”

The door opened a little wider, revealing a man in his early thirties. His face was gaunt, his hair disheveled, and his eyes darted nervously around the hallway. He looked like a man who hadn’t slept in weeks, haunted by what he knew. Without another word, he motioned them inside, quickly closing and locking the door behind them.

The apartment was dimly lit by a single flickering lamp. Empty takeout containers were scattered across the floor, and hastily drawn diagrams covered the walls—flowcharts, equations, lines of code scribbled on torn pieces of paper. It looked like the inside of a paranoid mind, laid out in chaotic order.

“Are you sure no one followed you?” the engineer asked, his voice trembling.

Haruto gave a curt nod. “We made sure. Now, talk. What do you know about Kimitsu’s AI?”

The man hesitated, looking between Haruto and Sakura. His hands trembled slightly as he sat down at the edge of an old couch. “I didn’t know what I was building at first. They told me it was just a matchmaking algorithm—a way to optimize human connections based on data. I thought it was revolutionary, something that would change the world for the better. But then... I saw the other side of it.”

Sakura sat across from him, her expression softening as she spoke. “What did you see?”

The engineer swallowed hard, his hands running nervously through his hair. “It wasn’t just about matchmaking. The algorithm was built to profile people, to analyze their psychological traits, their behaviors, their secrets. Kimitsu wasn’t just using it for dating—they were using it to control people, especially politicians. The platform was designed to find weaknesses in people, things that could be used against them—blackmail, leverage, manipulation. The algorithm would decide who could be controlled, who was a threat, and who needed to be... removed.”

Haruto leaned forward, his eyes narrowing. “Removed? You mean assassinated?”

The engineer nodded, his face pale. “Yes. The algorithm flagged people who were too dangerous, who could expose Kimitsu’s operations. It calculated the risk of keeping them alive versus... eliminating them. Once the decision was made, the orders were carried out without question. I didn’t know at first. By the time I realized what I was a part of, it was too late. People were already dead.”

Sakura’s heart sank as she listened. This was worse than even she had imagined. “How do we stop it?” she asked, her voice urgent.

The engineer’s eyes darted to the door, as if expecting someone to burst in at any moment. “There’s a backdoor in the system. It’s hidden deep, but if you can access it, you can disable the algorithm. But it’s dangerous. Kimitsu has layers of protection around it, and they’ll know if you try to access it.”

Haruto stood up, pacing the small room, his fists clenched in frustration. “Where’s this backdoor? How do we get to it?”

The engineer pointed to a set of diagrams on the wall, a tangled mess of code and flowcharts. “It’s buried in the mainframe, deep in their network. You’ll need someone with serious skills to break through. But once you’re in... you can shut it down.”

Sakura studied the diagrams, her mind racing with the possibilities. “I can do it,” she said, her voice resolute. “I’ve been inside their systems before. I know how they operate.”

The engineer looked at her, his eyes filled with a mixture of hope and fear. “You need to be careful. They won’t hesitate to kill you if they find out.”

Before anyone could respond, the sound of glass shattering echoed through the apartment. The engineer’s body jerked violently, a crimson stain blooming across his chest as he collapsed to the floor. Haruto was already moving, throwing himself to the side, pulling Sakura down with him as a second shot rang out.

“Sniper!” Haruto growled, scanning the room for cover. The window was now a gaping hole, shards of glass scattered across the floor. He crawled toward the edge of the window, peeking out just enough to see the distant glint of a rifle scope from a rooftop across the street.

Sakura scrambled to the engineer, her hands shaking as she pressed down on the wound, trying to stop the bleeding. “Stay with me!” she shouted, her voice cracking. But the engineer’s eyes were already glazing over, his breath coming in short, shallow gasps.

“Damn it!” Haruto cursed, pulling his gun from its holster. He fired a few shots toward the rooftop, but he knew it was futile. The sniper was too far away, too well-hidden. They needed to get out, now.

“Sakura, we have to move!” Haruto shouted, pulling her away from the dying engineer. He grabbed her arm, dragging her toward the door as another bullet tore through the wall, narrowly missing them.

Sakura’s mind was racing. The engineer was their only link to taking down Kimitsu, and now he was dying. She couldn’t let it all slip away. As they scrambled toward the door, she reached for the engineer’s laptop, grabbing it in one swift motion. If there was any chance of retrieving the data, it would be on that device.

Haruto kicked the door open, pulling Sakura into the hallway as more shots rang out behind them. They raced down the stairs, their footsteps echoing in the empty building. The sniper’s bullets followed them, each one a deadly reminder of how close they were to losing everything.

They burst out into the street, ducking behind a parked car for cover. Haruto scanned the rooftops, his eyes darting from building to building. The sniper was gone.

“We need to get out of here,” Haruto said, his breath ragged. “Now.”

Sakura nodded, clutching the laptop to her chest. “He’s dead, isn’t he?”

Haruto didn’t answer. He didn’t need to. The look in his eyes said it all.

They moved quickly, disappearing into the maze of back alleys, the tension between them palpable. The engineer was gone, and with him, the best chance they had at taking down Kimitsu. But they had the laptop. It was a slim hope, but it was all they had left.

As they made their way through the darkened streets, Haruto’s mind was already racing with the next steps. Kimitsu had shown their hand—if they were willing to kill to protect their secrets, then they were running out of time. But Haruto wasn’t about to back down. Not now.

“We’re not done yet,” Haruto said, his voice low but determined.

Sakura looked up at him, her eyes filled with a fierce resolve. “No, we’re not.”
