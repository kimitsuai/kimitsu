Chapter 13: The Corrupted Algorithm

The small underground hideout was suffocating in its chaos, a cluttered labyrinth of wires, monitors, and old equipment, all flickering in the dim glow of fluorescent bulbs that buzzed softly overhead. Sakura Watanabe sat hunched over a laptop, her fingers dancing across the keys, decrypting layer after layer of Kimitsu’s deeply buried secrets. The room was silent except for the faint hum of machines processing vast amounts of data. Each click of her keyboard felt like peeling away at the rotten skin of something unspeakably dangerous.

Her brows furrowed as she sifted through the labyrinthine code, a gut feeling building in her that this was more than she had anticipated. She had suspected Kimitsu’s AI was involved in some shady operations—it wasn’t the first time a tech giant had pushed ethical boundaries—but this was something else entirely. Her pulse quickened as new files emerged on the screen, each one revealing increasingly disturbing details about the system’s true design.

For months, she had assumed Kimitsu’s algorithm was simply a platform for matchmaking, for helping people connect in a world that was growing more isolated and disconnected. But the deeper she dug, the more it became clear that Kimitsu’s AI had a far darker purpose. Her eyes widened as a set of profiles flashed across the screen, not of ordinary users but of powerful politicians, corporate magnates, and influential public figures. Their lives had been dissected, analyzed by the algorithm, their deepest secrets and vulnerabilities laid bare in chillingly precise data logs.

Sakura’s heart raced as the pieces came together. This wasn’t about matchmaking. Kimitsu’s AI was a tool of control. The system had been weaponized, using its unparalleled access to personal information to profile political figures, track their weaknesses, and exploit them. There were hidden notes on each profile—details on blackmail targets, plans for orchestrating scandals, even contingency strategies for those deemed too dangerous to be kept alive. Assassination orders hidden beneath layers of innocuous code.

She exhaled, her breath shaky, her mind racing with horror at the implications. How many deaths had been linked to this algorithm? How many lives had been quietly snuffed out in the name of maintaining Kimitsu’s stranglehold on Tokyo? She clicked through to another set of files and felt her stomach twist—these were the politicians who had recently died, their deaths reported as accidents or health issues. But now it was clear: their deaths had been engineered, orchestrated by this algorithm to keep Kimitsu’s grip on power.

The cold reality of the conspiracy hit her like a wave. Kimitsu’s reach extended far beyond simple matchmaking—it was a machine designed to control the very fabric of society, to manipulate those in power and eliminate anyone who dared to challenge it.

“Sakura?” Haruto’s voice jolted her from her thoughts. He stood in the doorway, his broad frame silhouetted by the faint light spilling in from the hallway. His expression was hardened, as usual, but there was something in his eyes—a flicker of concern.

She turned to him, the gravity of her discovery weighing heavy in her voice. “It’s worse than we thought, Haruto. Kimitsu isn’t just corrupting data—they’re controlling lives. They’re orchestrating everything.”

Haruto stepped closer, his fists clenched at his sides. He hated this—the endless layers of deceit, the feeling of being outmaneuvered by a faceless enemy. “How bad?”

Sakura didn’t hesitate. “Bad enough that people are dying. They’ve used the algorithm to profile and target politicians, anyone who posed a threat. This isn’t just about power—it’s about survival. They’re eliminating anyone who could expose them.”

Haruto let out a low growl, pacing across the room like a caged animal. “We need to find the person behind this. Someone had to build this system. Someone who knows how to dismantle it.”

Sakura nodded, her fingers moving swiftly to pull up the encrypted files she had decrypted earlier. “There’s an AI engineer—someone who used to work for Kimitsu. I’ve traced their data trail. If we find them, they might be our best chance at taking this whole thing down.”

Haruto’s eyes darkened. “Then we find them. Now.”

Hours later, Haruto found himself in a dimly lit bar deep in the criminal heart of Tokyo, the kind of place where deals were made in whispers and fortunes exchanged in back-alley shadows. The smoke in the air was thick, mixing with the scent of stale beer and sweat, and the dim red lighting made it hard to see much beyond the figures huddled at tables. He didn’t need to see much—he already knew who he was looking for.

At a corner booth, a man sat hunched over a glass of whiskey, his eyes flicking nervously toward the entrance every few seconds. Haruto had been chasing down this lead for days, following a trail of dirty money that led back to Kimitsu’s operations. This informant was the missing link, a small-time crook who had been paid off to funnel money to the politicians who had ended up dead. He might not know much, but Haruto didn’t need much—just enough to keep the trail warm.

Haruto approached the booth with the confidence of a man who wasn’t to be trifled with. His heavy boots thudded against the floor, each step drawing the man’s attention. Haruto slid into the booth without invitation, his eyes locking on the informant’s.

“You know who I am,” Haruto said, his voice low and dangerous.

The informant swallowed hard, his eyes darting around the bar like a rat looking for an escape. “I don’t want any trouble, Nakamura. I just... I just do the jobs I’m paid to do.”

“And now you’re going to tell me who’s paying you,” Haruto said, leaning forward, his voice dripping with menace. “Kimitsu’s dirty money didn’t end up in those politicians’ pockets by accident.”

The man’s hands trembled as he raised his whiskey to his lips, taking a nervous sip. “I don’t know names... I just handle the transfers. It’s all electronic, all anonymous.”

Haruto’s patience was wearing thin. He slammed his hand on the table, rattling the glassware. “You’re lying. You know more than you’re letting on. People are dying because of this. You’re either going to talk, or I’ll make sure you never get another job in this city again.”

The informant’s face paled, the weight of Haruto’s threat sinking in. He leaned closer, lowering his voice to a whisper. “Okay, okay... There’s a system—a network of payments. Politicians, journalists, anyone with influence. They’re all getting paid off or silenced. It’s all tied to this AI... it decides who gets what, who lives, who dies. But there’s someone controlling it from behind the scenes. Someone powerful.”

Haruto’s jaw tightened. He knew it. This wasn’t just some rogue AI gone haywire—there was a puppet master pulling the strings. “Where do I find them?”

The informant shook his head, fear etched into his face. “I don’t know... but I’ve heard rumors. There’s an engineer, someone who built part of the system. They went into hiding after realizing what they were a part of. If you find them, you might find the answers you’re looking for.”

Haruto stood abruptly, leaving the informant trembling in his wake. He had what he needed. Now, it was time to act.

Meanwhile, across town, Yumi Takahashi sat alone in her television studio, the flickering light from her computer screen casting long shadows across the room. The place was quiet, eerily so, as she prepared to air another segment on Kimitsu’s corruption. She had already exposed some of the company's crimes during the protest, but this new report would hit harder—it tied Kimitsu directly to the deaths of several politicians.

She ran a hand through her hair, her nerves frayed from the stress of being constantly watched, followed, and threatened. She glanced down at her desk, where a plain manila envelope sat, unopened. It had been delivered earlier that day with no return address. Yumi’s hands trembled as she opened it, her breath catching as she pulled out a stack of photographs. They were of her—walking to work, meeting with sources, sitting at cafés. Someone had been watching her every move.

Her heart pounded in her chest, but she forced herself to stay calm. She knew the risks of pursuing this story, but she couldn’t stop now. Too many people were counting on her to reveal the truth. She tossed the photos aside and steeled herself, her fingers poised over the keyboard, ready to air her report.

But as the broadcast began, her phone buzzed. A message flashed on the screen: Stop now, or you won’t live to see the next sunrise.

Yumi’s breath caught in her throat. She glanced around the empty studio, the weight of the threat sinking in. She was in too deep now.

Later that night, Haruto and Sakura regrouped in the darkened streets outside a secluded, nondescript building. This was the place. The engineer they had been hunting was inside, hiding from the very system they had helped create. But as they approached, a shot rang out—echoing through the narrow alley.

Haruto dropped to the ground, pulling Sakura with him as a sniper’s bullet whizzed past. The game had just gotten deadlier.
