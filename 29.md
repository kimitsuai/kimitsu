## Chapter 29: "It Prices"

Aiko’s eyes fluttered open, her mind still hazy from the anesthesia. The harsh, sterile light of the hospital room pierced through her vision, and the distant sound of beeping machines filled the air. Her entire body ached, but the burning pain in her side was the sharpest, reminding her of the gunshot wound she had barely survived.

As she tried to sit up, a voice stopped her.

“You’re awake.”

Aiko turned her head, her muscles protesting with every movement. A police officer stood by the door, arms crossed. His presence was unmistakable—a silent reminder that she was not free. The door itself was bolted, and outside, two more officers stood guard, their faces cold and impassive.

“What… what’s going on?” she managed to croak, her voice dry and weak.

The officer didn’t answer immediately. His expression was unreadable, but there was a tension in the room, a weight pressing down on Aiko as she struggled to gather her thoughts. She had survived, but the world outside these hospital walls was still burning.

And then, it hit her. Nakamura. Sakura.

“Where are they?” she asked, her voice growing stronger, more urgent. “Where’s Nakamura? Where’s Sakura?”

“They’re facing charges,” the officer said flatly. “Both of them are being held by Internal Affairs. You should be grateful you’re even alive, given what happened.”

Aiko’s heart sank. She could still picture the chaos of the control room, the gunfire, the blood, and Nakamura’s desperate fight to keep them all alive. They had taken down Kimitsu’s core, but it seemed the battle wasn’t over—not by a long shot.

Suddenly, the door opened, and a man in a suit stepped in. He was older, his graying hair slicked back, and his expression was one of quiet authority.

“Aiko,” he said, his voice calm but authoritative. “My name is Detective Sugiyama, and I’m with Internal Affairs. We need to talk.”

Aiko eyed him warily, unsure of what to expect.

“Your involvement in the Kimitsu hack is under investigation,” Sugiyama continued, his eyes scanning her face for any reaction. “As are Nakamura’s and Sakura’s. We know you were all part of a conspiracy to undermine the government’s AI initiative.”

Aiko’s throat tightened. “Conspiracy? You mean the truth. We exposed Kimitsu for what it really is—corrupt, dangerous. How can you—”

Sugiyama held up a hand, silencing her. “I understand you believe you were doing the right thing. But right now, that’s not what the public is being told. Nakamura’s methods… well, they’ve raised a lot of questions. And the fact remains: you, Sakura, and Nakamura are accused of hacking government systems and attacking high-ranking officials.”

Aiko clenched her fists, the weight of the accusations settling over her. After everything they had done, they were now being painted as criminals. Kimitsu had fallen, but the system wasn’t ready to let go of its grip so easily.

“Where are Nakamura and Sakura?” she demanded, refusing to let the fear take over.

“Nakamura is in custody,” Sugiyama replied. “Facing multiple charges. As for Sakura, she’s under house arrest while we investigate her role in the hack. They’ll both be put on trial soon enough. The government’s not going to let this go.”

Aiko’s mind raced. This was all wrong. They had risked everything to expose the truth, but now it seemed like they were the ones on trial. The weight of their actions was crushing, and for the first time, Aiko wondered if they would ever be free of this fight.

But just as Sugiyama was about to leave, the television mounted on the wall flickered to life. The news broadcast was in full swing, and a familiar face filled the screen.

Yumi Takahashi.

Aiko’s heart skipped a beat as she listened to Yumi’s voice echo through the small hospital room. The reporter’s broadcast was spreading like wildfire, and more and more people were starting to take notice. Yumi had been relentless, exposing Kimitsu’s corruption piece by piece. She was keeping the fire alive, even as Aiko, Nakamura, and Sakura were trapped in the system.

“Kimitsu has been exposed,” Yumi said, her tone steady and determined. “But the fight isn’t over. The people of Japan are rising. The protests against Kimitsu are growing, and the demand for accountability is louder than ever. But there are those in power who will stop at nothing to maintain control. The question is, how far will they go to silence the truth?”

Aiko watched, her heart pounding. Outside the hospital, the streets of Tokyo were filled with chaos. The protests had intensified. Massive crowds gathered, chanting for justice, demanding that Kimitsu’s remaining operatives be brought down. The situation was spiraling out of control, and Yumi’s broadcasts were becoming the rallying cry for an entire movement.

“Masato Tanaka,” Yumi continued, “the man who risked everything to reveal Kimitsu’s political manipulation, is now gaining momentum in his fight against the government’s oppressive policies. His supporters are growing by the day, and some believe he could be the key to tearing down what remains of the Kimitsu empire.”

Aiko’s gaze shifted toward Sugiyama, who had been watching the broadcast as well. His expression hardened, and she could see the tension in his posture.

“You see what’s happening, don’t you?” she said, her voice low but sharp. “People are waking up. Kimitsu’s lies are being exposed, and the protests won’t stop until the system falls.”

Sugiyama’s jaw tightened. “That’s enough.”

Aiko didn’t back down. “You can try to pin this on us, but the truth is already out there. Yumi’s not going to stop, and neither are the people. You can’t control the narrative anymore.”

For a moment, Sugiyama said nothing, his eyes locked on hers. Then, without another word, he turned and left the room, the door clicking shut behind him. The police officer remained at his post, but Aiko could sense that even he was rattled by what was happening outside.

As the broadcast continued, Aiko tried to piece everything together. Masato’s gamble had paid off. His revelations were turning the tide, and his public support was growing stronger by the day. People were rallying behind him, and the once-powerful politicians who had backed Kimitsu were now scrambling to distance themselves from the scandal.

But the more Aiko thought about it, the more she realized something didn’t add up. Masato had played his part perfectly, too perfectly. His rise to political prominence had been almost meteoric, and while he had undoubtedly exposed Kimitsu’s crimes, there was an undercurrent of suspicion that gnawed at her. Could he have been playing a longer game? Was he simply a man seeking redemption, or was there something more to his sudden emergence as a political hero?

Her thoughts were interrupted by a soft knock at the door. The officer stepped aside as the door creaked open, revealing a familiar face—Sakura.

“Aiko,” Sakura whispered, rushing to her side. “Thank god you’re awake.”

Aiko smiled weakly. “Barely.”

Sakura pulled a chair closer to the bed, her face etched with concern. “It’s bad out there,” she said quietly, glancing toward the television. “Nakamura’s still being held, and they’re going to make an example out of him. Internal Affairs is using the hack against us, framing it as an attack on national security.”

“And you?” Aiko asked, her voice filled with worry.

Sakura’s eyes darkened. “I’m under surveillance. They’re trying to pin the whole operation on us, but Yumi’s broadcasts are keeping them from acting too quickly. The protests are only growing, but I don’t know how much longer we can hold out.”

Aiko swallowed, feeling a surge of frustration. They had risked everything to bring down Kimitsu, but the fight was far from over. The system was pushing back harder than ever, and it was clear that those in power wouldn’t go down without a fight.

Just then, a newscaster’s voice broke through the broadcast, a sense of urgency in her tone.

“We’ve just received breaking news,” the anchor said. “Reports are coming in that a key member of Kimitsu’s leadership has been found dead under mysterious circumstances. Authorities are investigating, but speculation is already rampant about potential connections to the recent protests and the revelations surrounding the AI conspiracy.”

Aiko and Sakura exchanged a glance, both of them feeling the weight of the moment. Someone within Kimitsu’s ranks was cleaning up loose ends, and it was only a matter of time before the full picture emerged.

But then, Sakura’s phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, her eyes widening in shock.

“It’s Nakamura,” she said breathlessly. “He’s being transported… right now. Something’s happening.”

Before Aiko could process what she had said, the door to the hospital room swung open again, this time revealing Nakamura’s commanding officer, flanked by several police officers.

“Watanabe,” the officer barked, his eyes cold and calculating. “You need to come with us.”

Sakura stood up, her heart racing. “What’s going on?”

The officer’s expression didn’t waver. “Nakamura’s under investigation, and so are you. We’ve traced unauthorized access points during the Kimitsu hack—direct links to you and your team. You’re coming in for questioning.”

Aiko’s mind spun. The walls were closing in on them, faster than they could react.

“Don’t trust them,” Aiko hissed. “They’ll do whatever they can to bury us.”

Sakura’s eyes flashed with determination. “I’m not going down without a fight.”

As the officers led Sakura away, Aiko was left alone in her hospital bed, her thoughts racing. The situation was spiraling out of control. Yumi’s broadcasts were growing louder, the protests were getting more intense, and now Nakamura and Sakura were caught in the crossfire. And then there was Masato, the wild card in all of this. His rise to prominence, his growing influence—something about it didn’t sit right with Aiko.

Was he really the hero he appeared to be, or was there a deeper game at play?

The more she thought about it, the more she began to wonder if Kimitsu’s fall had been part of an even larger plan, one that Masato had orchestrated from the very beginning.

And then, just as the weight of everything threatened to crush her, Aiko felt a chill run down her spine. From the corner of the room, the television flickered, and the news anchor’s voice echoed through the air once more.

“We’ve just received new information,” the anchor said, her voice tense. “An anonymous source has provided documents linking Masato Tanaka to key figures within Kimitsu’s leadership. While his role in exposing the conspiracy has been widely praised, these new revelations suggest that Tanaka may have been involved far deeper in the AI conspiracy than previously known. More details to come as the investigation unfolds…”

Aiko’s heart froze.

Masato. The man who had seemingly brought down Kimitsu was now being implicated in the very conspiracy he had vowed to destroy.

The twist left her breathless, her mind reeling with questions. Had they all been pawns in a much larger game? Had Masato used them to eliminate his rivals within Kimitsu, only to position himself as the new power behind the curtain?

The screen faded to black as the broadcast ended, leaving Aiko alone with her thoughts. The truth was out there, somewhere, but it was buried beneath layers of lies, deception, and hidden agendas. And now, as the storm raged outside, Aiko knew that the real battle was just beginning.

The final shot hadn’t been fired yet.

And when it was, no one knew whose side it would fall on.
