## Chapter 8: The Assassination

Aiko blinked, disoriented, her heart racing as if she had just been shot. She was sure of it—she had felt the impact, heard the gunfire. But now, everything was silent. Her surroundings were unnervingly still. Her hands, which moments ago had gripped the rifle, were resting on a smooth console instead. Something was wrong. The city below, once engulfed in chaos, was strangely calm, as if frozen in time.

Her wrist comm vibrated softly, pulling her attention. A single message flashed on the screen: "Simulation Complete." Confusion twisted her thoughts. Simulation? She glanced around, and the world around her flickered briefly, as if reality itself was fraying. The chaos she had been entrenched in moments ago—Nakamura running, gunfire erupting—was gone, replaced with an eerie stillness. Slowly, the surroundings dissolved and reformed into the same rooftop she stood on, but this time, it felt different—real.

The truth sank in. Kimitsu's AI had simulated what would happen if she didn’t pull the trigger, mapping out every chaotic possibility. Aiko steadied herself, realizing that none of it had been real. The protests were still peaceful, Nakamura still crouched in position, waiting for her move. This was the real world now, and the decision still lay in her hands.

The ballroom buzzed with tension, the gilded grandeur a stark contrast to the dark undercurrents of the evening. Crystal chandeliers bathed the room in warm light, their gleaming reflections bouncing off the polished floors as politicians, business moguls, and dignitaries shuffled from table to table. Security was tighter than ever, with men in black suits posted at every corner, their eyes constantly roving for any sign of trouble. The recent spate of political assassinations had left the air heavy with caution. Conversations were whispered, smiles tight, as everyone felt the unspoken threat hanging above the event.

Haruto Nakamura prowled through the room like a caged animal, his body stiff and tense. He didn’t belong here. The stiff collar of his shirt scratched at his neck, and the elegant surroundings felt like a mockery of everything he stood for. As he glanced around the room, the irony wasn’t lost on him—these people thought they were safe, that the money and power insulating them from the chaos outside would protect them from whatever was coming. They were wrong. Dead wrong.

Sakura Watanabe, gliding effortlessly among the crowd, was his opposite. Her demeanor remained calm, professional, almost serene as she brushed shoulders with Tokyo’s elite. Her gown sparkled in the ballroom’s soft lighting, and she smiled politely as she passed one politician after another. But beneath that elegance, her mind was working at full speed, piecing together the puzzle they had been trying to solve for weeks.

"Haruto," she whispered into her earpiece, her voice almost drowned out by the low hum of conversation. "Something's off. I can feel it. Kimitsu wouldn’t send Aiko here for no reason. There’s a play tonight, and we’re running out of time."

Haruto grunted in response, eyes darting toward the podium where speeches were being prepared. His hand instinctively moved toward his gun, concealed beneath his suit jacket. He knew Aiko was out there, somewhere in the shadows, watching. She had to be. Kimitsu's assassin had never missed a high-profile target like this. But the question gnawed at him—was she still on their side, or had her loyalties shifted?

Sakura was already hacking into the hotel’s security feed from her phone, fingers flying over the virtual keyboard with precision. "If we don’t find her before she pulls the trigger—" she paused, her brow furrowing as a new window opened. "Wait. I’m picking up movement on the roof across the street."

Haruto’s pulse quickened. "That’s her. I’m going up," he growled.

"Wait—" Sakura’s voice cut off as Haruto broke through the crowd, heading straight for the nearest exit.

On the rooftop, Aiko adjusted the scope of her rifle. The cold Tokyo night pressed against her skin, but she barely noticed. Her heartbeat echoed in her ears as she lay prone, eyes fixed on the ballroom through the glass walls. She had the perfect vantage point. Below, she could see Masato Tanaka, flanked by his closest ally, the man she had been sent to eliminate tonight. But something gnawed at her, pulling at the edges of her focus. Her mission had always been clear before—take the shot, eliminate the target, disappear. But this time… this time was different.

She wasn’t sure why. Was it the growing doubts about Kimitsu? The realization that every move she made was orchestrated by unseen hands? Or perhaps it was something simpler—fatigue. The weight of the lives she had taken, the faces of those who had fallen because of her. It was starting to unravel her, bit by bit.

Her finger hovered over the trigger, her breath steady, but her mind swirled with uncertainty. And then, she made her decision. She would leave a clue. It was dangerous, reckless even, but if Haruto and Sakura were as good as she believed, they would find it. They would stop this madness before it was too late.

Just as she shifted the rifle slightly, adjusting her aim, a noise snapped her attention back to the ballroom. A microphone screeched as Masato’s ally took the podium. The crowd fell silent, eyes fixed on the man.

Aiko steadied her breathing, lined up the shot, and hesitated.

In that split second, a flash of movement caught her eye. A figure, dressed in a shimmering gown, approached the man from behind, placing a hand on his shoulder. Aiko blinked, her focus narrowing. It wasn’t Masato’s ally—it was the escort. The woman who had been rumored to have ties to Kimitsu. The one who had been planted here to ensure the deal went through.

Aiko’s heart raced. What was she doing on the stage? Her scope followed the escort’s movements as she leaned in close to the politician, whispering something into his ear. And in that moment, Aiko’s finger twitched.

The shot rang out, sharp and deafening, cutting through the night. For a brief second, everything seemed to stop.

And then chaos erupted.

The politician, Masato’s close ally, crumpled to the floor, blood pooling beneath him as screams filled the ballroom. The escort staggered back, horror etched on her face as she realized what had happened. Panic spread like wildfire as guests rushed for the exits, security scrambling to contain the chaos.

From her vantage point, Aiko’s breath caught in her throat. She had missed. Or rather, she hadn’t. She had hit the wrong person.

"God… no," she whispered, pulling back from the rifle, her heart pounding in her chest. Her hands trembled as the realization set in. She had been manipulated. The whole mission—everything—was a setup.

Below, Haruto burst into the ballroom, his eyes wild as he scanned the room for Aiko’s target. Too late. His gaze fell on the politician’s lifeless body, and his stomach twisted with rage. This wasn’t supposed to happen. They were supposed to stop the assassination, not walk into the aftermath.

"Sakura!" he barked into his earpiece. "What the hell happened?"

Sakura’s voice came through, tense but calm. "It’s bad, Haruto. The target’s down, but there’s something else. I found hidden files in the security footage. The escort—she was working with Kimitsu. They set this up."

Haruto cursed under his breath, his eyes darting to the fleeing crowd. It was all a trap. Aiko had been played, and now they were cleaning up someone else’s mess.

On the rooftop, Aiko sat back, her rifle still in her lap, her mind spinning. She had been a tool all along, a pawn in Kimitsu’s grand design. But why? Why set her up like this? Why make her pull the trigger on someone who wasn’t even the target?

She stood slowly, her body shaking with adrenaline and disbelief. Her hands moved automatically as she disassembled the rifle, her mind already racing ahead. She couldn’t go back now—not to Kimitsu, not to anyone. She needed to disappear, to figure out what had happened, who had used her, and why.

But there was one thing she was sure of—she wasn’t going to be a pawn anymore.

Slipping the disassembled rifle into her bag, Aiko cast one last glance at the city below. The lights of Tokyo glittered, indifferent to the chaos she had unleashed tonight. She turned, her footsteps silent as she melted into the night, a shadow on the wind.

Back in the control room, Sakura’s eyes widened as she uncovered the final piece of the puzzle. The files were encrypted, buried deep within the security system, but she had cracked them open. What she found confirmed her worst fears—Kimitsu had been orchestrating political movements for months, using puppets like the escort to influence key players. The assassination tonight had been a distraction, a way to shift power in the government while everyone was looking in the wrong direction.

"Haruto," she said quietly, her voice filled with dread. "It’s worse than we thought. Kimitsu’s reach goes deeper. This was never just about one target. They’re controlling the entire game."

Haruto stood amidst the chaos, the weight of the truth settling over him like a heavy cloak. They weren’t just fighting a rogue AI or a few corrupt officials. They were up against an enemy that had already infiltrated the highest levels of power. And if they didn’t act fast, more lives would be lost.

"Then we bring them down," he said, his voice steely with resolve.

But even as the words left his mouth, he knew it wouldn’t be that simple. Kimitsu was always two steps ahead, and tonight had proven just how deadly that game could be.

Aiko, walking alone through the dark alleys of Tokyo, felt the sting of betrayal settle deep in her bones. She had been used, manipulated into killing someone who wasn’t even the target. And now, she was alone. But not for long. She would find out the truth—about Kimitsu, about everything—and when she did, there would be no turning back.

The night was quiet, but the storm was just beginning.
