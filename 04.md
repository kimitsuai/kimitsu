## Chapter 4: "The Protest"

The streets of Tokyo were a sea of chaos, swelling with bodies that surged toward the heart of the city like a living organism. Protesters clogged the avenues, their banners and placards raised high above their heads, the words scrawled across them drenched in fury. "Justice for Mori!" they chanted, their voices rising in a thunderous crescendo that echoed through the urban canyons. The air smelled of sweat, petrol, and anticipation—an oppressive mixture that made the police lines feel paper-thin. It seemed the entire city had turned out, and the overwhelming emotion was rage.

In a small café just off the main protest route, Yumi Takahashi sat with her back to the wall, her notepad on the table in front of her. Her recorder sat between them, the witness’s eyes darting nervously toward it every few moments. Yumi had chosen the corner booth deliberately; it gave her a good view of the room while also allowing the jittery man across from her a semblance of privacy.

"So you were there that night?" she asked, keeping her voice low and even.

The man fidgeted, his fingers picking at the edge of the cup in front of him. "I wasn’t supposed to be," he muttered. "But yeah, I was there. I saw him."

Yumi leaned forward, her pen poised over the notepad. "You saw Takashi Mori?"

The man shook his head. "Not Mori. I saw... someone else. A woman. She was there, right before it happened."

Yumi’s pulse quickened. This could be something—maybe even the break she needed. "What did she look like?"

The man rubbed his temples, his face creased with the effort of recalling the memory. "I couldn’t see her face. It was dark, and she was wearing a hood. But she wasn’t just standing there, you know? She was doing something... with her phone. Like she was controlling something. And then, the shot."

Yumi felt a jolt of adrenaline. "Do you think she was involved? Did she do it?"

"I don’t know," the man whispered, his voice barely audible over the din of the café. "But I didn’t stick around to find out."

Yumi scribbled furiously in her notebook, every word a potential lead. Her mind raced with possibilities. Who was the woman? Was she connected to Kimitsu, or was this something else entirely? She knew she was on to something, but before she could dig further, her phone buzzed on the table, breaking her focus.

"Excuse me for a moment," she said, quickly grabbing the phone and stepping away from the table. She glanced at the screen—a message from one of her sources at the precinct. Her stomach flipped as she read the words: Leaked video implicating Kimitsu. Check the news.

She glanced back at the witness, who was still nervously fiddling with his cup. This interview could wait. If there was a leak involving Kimitsu, it could change everything. Yumi thanked the man hastily and bolted out the door, her heart pounding as she made her way back toward her office.

Meanwhile, across town, Detective Haruto Nakamura sat hunched over his desk, staring at the mountain of evidence before him. His frustration had only grown in the hours since Mori’s murder. Every lead seemed to point to Kimitsu, yet none of it was concrete enough to make an arrest. He slammed his fist against the desk, sending a stack of papers tumbling to the floor.

"This is ridiculous," he muttered under his breath. "They’ve covered their tracks too well."

Sakura Watanabe stood beside him, her face illuminated by the glow of her laptop screen. She had been pouring over AI data for hours, trying to untangle the web of anomalies they’d uncovered. "I think I’m close to something," she said, not looking up from her work. "The AI code isn’t just designed to run systems; it’s actively manipulating them. It’s almost like someone is using the code to control the flow of information, both in the digital space and in the real world."

Haruto rubbed his eyes, exhaustion creeping in. "So, what are we saying? That Kimitsu is using AI to orchestrate all of this? The murder, the public reaction, the protests?"

Sakura nodded. "It’s not a stretch. If they have this kind of control over the AI systems, they could be shaping the entire narrative. It wouldn’t just be about silencing Mori—it would be about manipulating the response to his death to serve their agenda."

Before Haruto could respond, the TV in the corner of the precinct office blared to life, cutting through the quiet murmur of the room. "Breaking news," the announcer said, her voice tinged with urgency. "A leaked video implicating the Kimitsu Corporation in the assassination of Takashi Mori has just surfaced. The footage, released anonymously to multiple media outlets, appears to show a meeting between Kimitsu executives and a group of unidentified individuals just hours before the murder."

Haruto’s head snapped toward the screen, his eyes narrowing as the video played. The grainy footage showed a dimly lit room, a group of men and women seated around a table. In the center of the frame was a man wearing a Kimitsu badge, his face partially obscured by shadows. The conversation was muffled, but the words "Mori" and "eliminate" were unmistakable.

Sakura’s breath caught in her throat as she watched the footage. "This... this changes everything."

Haruto stood, his body tense with a mix of anger and determination. "If this video is real, then we finally have proof. Kimitsu orchestrated the hit. They’ve been pulling the strings all along."

But something didn’t sit right with him. It was too easy, too perfectly timed. The leak, the footage—it all felt orchestrated. "Who sent this?" he asked, his voice low.

Sakura shook her head. "There’s no information on the source. It just appeared out of nowhere."

Haruto’s mind raced as he considered the implications. If Kimitsu was powerful enough to manipulate AI and public opinion, could they also be playing a game with the police? Could this leak be another move in their strategy to control the narrative?

Before he could voice his concerns, Sakura’s phone rang, the shrill sound cutting through the tension. She answered quickly, her face paling as she listened to the voice on the other end. "Haruto," she said, her voice shaky. "There’s been another development. Someone’s targeting Aiko. She’s not safe."

Haruto’s stomach dropped. Aiko was one of their best informants, someone who had been feeding them inside information on Kimitsu. If she was in danger, it meant they were getting closer to the truth—and Kimitsu knew it.

"We need to move, now," Haruto said, grabbing his coat. "Get a team together. We’re not losing her."

Across the city, in a darkened apartment, Aiko sat alone, her hand steady as she adjusted the silencer on her gun. She knew this day would come, the day when Kimitsu finally came for her. She had been careful, but not careful enough. They had found her.

She glanced at the clock, her pulse steady despite the tension thrumming in the air. She had one shot left, one chance to take out her target before Kimitsu took her out. But just as she raised the gun, her body froze.

A cold pressure pressed against the back of her skull—the unmistakable feeling of a gun barrel.

"Going somewhere?" a voice whispered in her ear, sending a chill down her spine.

Aiko’s heart raced, her finger twitching on the trigger. She hadn’t expected this. She hadn’t expected another assassin.

As the world seemed to close in around her, she realized that Kimitsu wasn’t just after her—they had sent someone else. Someone who had beaten her to the punch.

The gun pressed harder against her head, and in that moment, Aiko knew she had underestimated her enemy. Her fate now hung by a thread, her future uncertain.

And in that silence, the city of Tokyo continued to rage, unaware that the real battle had only just begun.
